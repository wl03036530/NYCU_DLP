# NYCU_DLP
2021 NYCU資工所 Deep Learning and Practice class  
teacher:陳永昇、吳毅成、彭文孝

## LAB 1
Do backpropagatioin.

## LAB 2
Using TD (Temporal difference) learning algorithm in N-tuple network to solve the 2048 game.

## LAB 3
Implement two architectures (EEGNet and DeepConvNet) to classify images, and test the differences in the results of three different activation functions (ELU, ReLU, Leaky ReLU). 

## LAB 4
Implement ResNet18 and ResNet50 to classify images into five categories , and then test whether there is a difference in the accuracy of the pretrained model. 

## LAB 5
Implement a Conditional Seq2Seq VAE .  
Input a word and designate one of its four forms (sp,tp,pg,p), and then output the word of that form.  
(ex: input: eat, p > output: ate)

## LAB 6
Implement two deep reinforcement algorithms, DQN(deep Q-network) and DDPG(deep deterministic policy gradien).

## LAB 7
Use two Generator models (GAN, NF) to generate pictures with specified conditions.
