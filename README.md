## LAB 1
Do backpropagatioin.

## LAB 2
Using TD (Temporal difference) learning algorithm in N-tuple network to solve the 2048 game.

## LAB 3
Implement two architectures (EEGNet and DeepConvNet) to classify images, and test the differences in the results of three different activation functions (ELU, ReLU, Leaky ReLU). 

## LAB 4
Implement ResNet18 and ResNet50 to classify images into five categories , and then test whether there is a difference in the accuracy of the pretrained model. 

## LAB 5
Implement a seq2seq VAE
